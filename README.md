# Star Citizen VR - A Guide
If you are reading this it means you are ready to experience **Star Citizen**
like never before. This guide is free for all and anyone is welcome to copy,
modify, re-distribute or share in what ever way they choose, so long as they do
not charge or limit access for personal gain.

My own journey (still going) into ***Star Citizen VR*** would never be possible if
not for the incredible SC community that has worked together along with  the
fantastic devs to share information and guides. The VR gaming community may  be
one of the most welcoming groups of people I've found on the internet who just
want to share this amazing way to experience games and virtual worlds.  So I
continue the sharing as this is just a collection of the many tidbits I gathered
throughout my journey.

Special Thanks to all the brilliant minds on [Star Citizen Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/startcitizen) and [Chachi's VR Citizen Discord](discord.gg/kJ9RHRuc6j) who have provided many of the tips and tricks in this guide.

## Who is this appropriate for
Any ***Star Citizen*** play who is either just curious about playing in VR, or
the hardened VR veteran looking for tips to improve their experience.

## Do I need to buy anything?
While this guide and the knowledge that has been collected in it are absolutely
free, there are quite a few things to invest in to improve and enhance your
enjoyment of ***Star Citizen VR***, in particular the VR Headset. At the time of
writing this I only own a Meta Quest 3, but will try to offer other options and
info when possible.

## Updates and Plans
***Star Citizen VR*** is *EXPERIMENTAL* and *WILL* change.  I will do my best to
stay up to date and current with the latest changes and information, but please
be patient while we all discover the best ways to tune our SCVR experiences.

## Now What?
There is no single magic trick or fix nor software or plugin that will make
***Star Citizen VR*** perfect, but instead a series of incremental improvements
that will have a cumulative effect on your VR experience. We will touch on as
many of these as possible but recommend you also do your own seeking for
knowledge, and if you find something helpful, *Let Us Know!*

# The Physical Things
You are going to need a **VR** headset in order to experience ***Star Citizen
VR*** and a computer capable of feeding the headset double the frames you might
normally experience with just a monitor.  This poses unique challenges for VR
that your average gamer does not have to contend with.   

## A Brief Primer on Virtual Reality
In order to trick your brain into thinking it is seeing depth in the game it
uses an age old trick of providing two different views, one for each eye that
creates proper parallax and convinces our brains we are seeing something 3D. To
accomplish this illusion the game must render two different points of view (one
for  each eye) and send them to the headset, effectively doubling the amount of
rendering necessary.  To make it even worse one of the biggest contributors to
motion sickness in VR is the frame rate and latency.  While you may have been ok
dipping down to the 30s on your 8K monitor, you will want to maintain 60fps+
while rendering two eyes.   

### Motion Sickness! Oh no!
You've undoubtedly heard of VR motion sickness bynow, if not here is a
heads up!  Some people experience motion sickness while using VR headsets due to
small (or big) incongruities between what the brain expects to experience, and
what we actually experience.  For example, when you move forward and see the
feedback of the world moving around you, your brain also expects to feel that
movement via the inner ear, the feel of air moving across your skin, and the
physical muscle movement of your legs.  VR can only provide one of those inputs
so the brain goes "WHOA! WHOA! I don't like this!" and you feel very green and
like you might puke.  Luckily there are some things we can do to help with this.

- **Time**: Usually people adapt and get their "*VR*" legs, not dissimilar to
the idea of Sea Legs.  This depends on the person and how quickly they adapt.
- **Fans**: You can trick the brain with a little physical sensation by having a
  small fan on your desk blowing on your face to help the brain accept what it
is seeing.
- **Frame Rate**: High frame rates remove the delay between frames, resulting is smooth motion without blur or stutter. This has a outsized effect on motion sickness.  
- **Latency**: Keeping latency (delay between action and seeing it happen) as
low as possible will help a lot with the brains sense of reality.  The more
disconnected the visuals are from the expected feedback the worse it will get.
- **Acclimate**: Play some VR games that don't require movement or rapid input to
  help your brain acclimate to the headset and 3D environments.

In the end every individual is different so your experience of this can and will
vary.

## Eye Position
More than anything the position of our eyes in relation to the lenses and
screens in our VR headsets will have the biggest impact on our experience, more
than just about anything else.  A centimeter forward, back up or down can make
the difference between a blurry and muddy nausea filled visual and sharp crisp and comfortable view.

### Pupillary Distance (PD or IPD)
This is the distance between the center of your pupils when looking straight
ahead, typically measured in centimeters. Knowing this measurement is important
for modern VR headsets so that we can make adjustments to the lens position so
the center of the lens is lined up with your pupils.  If the lenses are not
aligned you are likely to experience disorientation or VR sickness, as well as
soft or blurry visuals.

The lenses of the headset are calibrated to have the sharpest image in the
center, with a gradual fall off that enables a wide field of view as you go to
the outside edges of the lens. (*this is my understanding and may not be an
accurate description*)

#### Measuring the Pupillary Distance
In order to get your personal and unique PD or IPD you have a couple options.
The simplest is using a ruler and a mirror, the fanciest is using an app on your
phone and the most rewarding is getting a friend to help you.  

* Rule and Mirror
    1. Get a ruler of some sort that has centimeters indicated on it.  It can be
       hard, see through, soft, cloth anything will really work.
    2. Find a good mirror and lean close to it so you can see the marks of the
       ruler clearly while holding it over your eyes. Make sure you keep looking
       straight ahead the entire time.
    3. Close the eye on the opposite side of the ruler with the 0 mark and align
       the `0` over the center of your pupil.  If you can bring the ruler down
    so it covers part of your eye to be as accurate as possible it is
    encouraged.
    4. Hold the ruler tightly in place and close the first eye and open the
       second.
    5. Read the mark on the ruler aligned with the center of your pupil on your
       second eye.  This number (typically between 60-70mm) is your ***Pupilary
       Distance***.  Write it down somewhere so you don't forget.

* The friends we made along the way
    1. Find a friend (the hard part).  Family members will suffice and a
       stranger in a pinch.
    2. Have them follow the instructions above, but they are the mirror and can
       easily see the marks over the center of your pupils while you look
    straight ahead.

* AI Overlords
    1. Download an app such as <APP1> or <APP2> and use the camera on your phone
       and some kind of facial recognition to make a best guess at your PD /
    IPD.  
    2. Note the number so you can see how wrong it is later when you use a ruler
       because nothing lines up right.


### Eye to Lens Distance
In the same vein it is recommended that you get your eyes as close to the lens
of the headset as possible to provide the best experience.  As you move closer
to the lens you will be able to see more of the outside part of the screens as
well as have more "sweet spot" in the middle as it is closer.   Most headsets
allow some rudimentary adjustments for distance, and third party facial
interfaces that allow much finer adjustments and make room for those who must
wear glasses or other vision aides.  

### Vertical Eye Adjustment
This is a more manual adjustment that is normally just a case of making sure the
headset and facial interface are comfortably aligned up and down with your eyes
and secure so it wont slip.  To achieve this I recommend loosening any straps or
controls for your head mount and holding the headset against your face *gently*
with a free hand.  Then while looking at a test image or something with a lot of
text, carefully adjust the headset not only up and down on your face and where
it rests on your cheek bones until the image becomes as sharp as possible.
Once you have done this gently tighten the head straps so that the facial
interface does not move and feels secure.  Some head mounts have a strap or
adjustment running across the top of your head to take the weight of the headset
and make it comfortable, be sure tighten this until the facial interface is just
lightly pressing against your face/cheekbones.  

### Lens Angle
Lastly and your millage may vary some headsets allow you to also change the
angle of the headset/facial interface so that the lenses are more or less flat
to your eyes. While viewing some kind of text or test image try looking down or
up with your face still facing forward.  If the image becomes sharper than when
looking straight ahead you can try slightly tweaking the tilt of the headset
while keeping it secure and comfortable and it may improve your experience. This
may also be an indicator that you could use prescription lens inserts as you are
seeing things sharper through the thicker part of the lens.  

### Prescriptions and Headsets
If at the end of the day you just cannot get a sharp image and everything is
blurry no matter what you try, you may need a prescription.  You have a few
options to help in this case.

#### Custom Prescription Inserts
These are custom shaped lenses you can order with your prescription and they
will be sent to you and typically use magnets or some kind of clip to snap into
your headset in-front of the lenses.

**Pros** 
* No need for glasses or contacts, you can comfortably wear the
headset with minimal fuss.
* Often very affordable and custom to your prescription/headset.

**Cons*
* Quality may not be as good as lenses from an optometrist.
* The additional layer lenses may increase reflections and glare.

#### Contact Lenses
Some users prefer these, especially if they are part of their daily ware.  These
must be got using a prescription from an Optometrist, though there are some over
the shelf versions it is highly discouraged.  

**Pros**
* Custom fit and high quality.  If the prescription is up to date these should
solve any visual issues without adding additional layers of glass or plastic
lenses.
* May already be part of your 

#### Contact Lenses
Some folks prefer to wear contacts with VR as it does not interfere with the
visuals (inserts can so)

# How To Get The Best Experience
There is no single magic trick for to get the most out of ***Star Citizen VR***,
instead we will go through a series of 



One of the most important things you can do to ensure you have a good VR experience in ***STAR CITIZEN VR*** is to get your headset well placed on your head, comfortable and make sure the physical IPD adjustments (if they are available) are as correct as possible for your unique face and eyes.

1. Ensure the headset rests comfortably on your face, with a VR environment open, try sliding it up and down a bit to see where the ***Sweet Spot*** is where things are sharpest.  Once you find this look up and down with your eyes only.  If it is sharper down or up you may need prescription lenses as you are viewing the environment through stronger magnification at those points.  Keep adjusting in small increments until it is both comfortable and as sharp as possible when looking forward.

2. Use a ruler or tape measure to calculate your ***Inter Pupillary Distance*** (IPD).  This is the distance in centimeters between your pupils.  There are apps that will do this for you, but in my experience they are usually not even close to accurate, but if you have no way to physically measure then use them.
    - Go to a bathroom or hallways mirror that you can lean in and get close to (the closer the better within reason).  Close one eye and line up the `0` mark on your ruler (the cm side) with one of your pupils, try to keep the ruler or tape measure as close to your eye as comfortable for accuracy.
    - Press against your brow or find a way to ensure the 0 mark does not move, then close that eye and open the other.  Take note of the value in cenitmeters that is directly lined up with the center of your pupil that is now open.  Ensure you are looking straight ahead into the mirror.
    - Write down this measurement, it is your IPD and a good thing to remember.

`This whole process is much easier if you happen to have an eye exam and can ask the doctor for your IPD, or have a friend do the measurements while you look straight ahead.`

3. Take this hard won number and with your headset on in its most comfortable position, adjust the ***Physical IPD** for the headset as *close* as possible to your IPD.  Not all headsets have this adjustment, and some offer much finer adjustments than others, for example Quest2 offers three ranges to pick from where Quest3/3s offers a slider between a large range of common IPD.  If your IPD falls outside these ranges, again just go to the maximum as close to your IPD as possible.

Once your IPD has been set on your headset you can again play with the positioning/angle just to make sure its still as sharp as possible.  A good headstrap and facial interface can make a world of difference for this.  Bellow are some recommend accessorie for headsets, but I only own a Meta Quest 3 so if others wish to make recommendations please let me know!

## Headset Accessories
* *Disclosure this section uses amazon links that give me a few cents if someone uses them.  If you enjoy this guide and want to help me buy more VR toys please use these for your purchases.*
  
These headset accessories can greatly improve your VR gaming experience in ***Star Citizen*** but are *not* required.  If you can afford them it is recommended for both your comfort and the ability to correctly position the headset for the clearest and most immersive experience.

### Quest 3 / 3S

#### **Meta Quest Elite Strap**  
Meta's own advanced headstrap with or without a battery on the back to help with headset life and balance. (Note when using Virtual Desktop you can go completely wireless so batteries can be nice if you dont mind the extra weight)
* [Amazon - w/ battery](https://amzn.to/3N2QHAN)
* [Amazon - no battery](https://amzn.to/4qb8zI3)

#### **BoboVR S3 Pro Battery Strap**  
This headset is like the swiss army knife of headsets including high capacity 10000mah hot-swappable battery, very comfortable headstrap that really supports the headset and even a cooling fan to keep your Quest 3/3s nice and cool.  It comes at the cost of adding a not small amount of weight, but many say the counterbalance of the battery and the better support makes it feel more comofrtable than default or meta straps.
* [Amazon](https://amzn.to/4aPfAtw)

#### **AMVR FC3 Upgraded Facial Interface**  
This interface allows you to easily adjust the depth between your eyes and the lenses, providing a closer distance at default and a knob on either side to move your eyes further away and make room for glasses or luxurious lashes. It comes with two pads you can choose betweeen, a neoprene face pad and a more tradition faux vinyl padded pad(???).  Compared to the default facial interface this product provides excellent light lock which is ideal for immersion in ***Star Citizen VR***

# Software
It is highly recommended you use [Virtual Desktop](https://https://www.vrdesktop.net/) to stream the game to your headset in most instances. This software uses a wireless network to connect and stream modern codecs such as h.264 or AV1 to provide crisp clear quality, but requires 5ghz or better wireless router that is ideally in the same room in line of sight of your headset, also ideally dedicated to just this job.

If you cannot afford the above or lack the required wireless equipment it will fall to your headsets standard PCVR solution, such as Meta Link for Quest 2/3/3s.  

## Virtual Desktop Settings
If you have a 5-6ghz dedicated router it is recommended under the streaming settings you use H.264+ at 500Mbit for the least latency and highest quality results.  If your network is not capable of supporting that without stuttering or issues and you have a Quest3, use AV1 for the lower bandwidth high quality option.  AV1 has the advantage of being a 10-bit codec so it is very pretty, but more prone to smearing and latency as it is complex to decode for the headset. 


# Star Citizen VR Settings
To play star citizen in VR you should first ensure you are able to run **Vulkan** in game. **DX11** will not work for VR with Star Citizen in its current incarnation. Again be aware this is an experimental feature and a lot will change in coming updates. 

## Console Tweaks
These settings are not cut and paste, you will want to play with these to get markers for QT and ships to look "right".  This is a temporary work around until **CIG** implements something more robust and handles the 2D text layers of the HUD in a way that makes sense for the 3D environment.  The settings below are ***MY*** settings and again you should start with things at a low number and experiment with them till they look good for ***YOU*** as these are dependent on the physical *IPD* settings of your headset and the *IPD Scaling* setting in the menus.


`r_StereoScaleformDepth = 4` - Push the depth of labels out?  
`r_StereoUILayerScale = 1.25` - Use this to bring the markers together  
`r_StereoUiLensDepth = 20` - This is the same as IPD Scale slider in the VR settings, recommend you use that.  

# Bonus Software

## Open Kneeboard  

This application will allow you to create viewport in your VR environment that
lets you view PDFs, notes, images, websites and even stream applications like
chat or TTY Terminals to play with your favorite linux shell. It is very
configurable and can use both keyboard and controller shortcuts to switch views
or hide the *Kneeboard* view.  You may even have multiple windows in your
environment if you like to see many things at once.
